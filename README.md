# GOOGLE ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS CAPSTONE PROJECT
## Sailfort Motors - Employee Turnover Prediction

### 📌 Project Overview
Sailfort Motors is experiencing a high rate of employee turnover. Employee departures - both voluntary and involuntary - are creating financial strain due to the recruitment, onboarding, and training costs.
This project aims to analyze employee survey data and built predictive models to:
1. Identify key drivers of employee turnover
2. Predict whether an employee is likely to leave
3. Provide actionable recommendations to improve retentions

### 🎯 Business Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts employee departure based on:
- Job role
- Department
- Number of Projects
- Average monthly hours
- Performance metrics
- Satisfaction indicators
- And other relevant attributes
The goal is to support the leadership in making data-driven retention decision.

### 🛠️ Methodology 
This project follows the following **PACE** framework:
1. **PLAN**: Define the business problem and stakeholder goals
2. **ANALYZE**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. **CONSTRUCT**: Build and evaluate predictive models
4. **EXECUTE**: Provide insights and business recommendations

Models evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
5. ROC-AUC

Special attention was given to recall and false negatives as failing to identify at-risk employees has direct business consequences. 

### 🔍 Key Outcomes
1. Identified top factors driving employee turnover
2. Compared statistical vs machine learning approaches
3. Delivered retention strategy recommendations to leadership

### 🧰 Tools Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. XGBoost
6. Matplotib/Seaborn

### 🎖️ Certification
Completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate** (via. Coursera)
